<title>History of html</html>
<p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a way to
 structure and link documents on the World Wide Web. HTML 2.0, the first official version, 
was standardized in 1995. Over the years, HTML evolved with HTML 4.0 in 1999, introducing
 CSS for design and improved structure. In the 2000s,<br> XHTML introduced stricter syntax
 rules. HTML5, finalized in 2014, brought new features like multimedia support, new semantic 
elements, and APIs for modern web applications. Today, HTML5 remains the standard for 
development.</p>
